Hi, I'm IÃ±aki! I learned programming starting 2021 by myself, later i got into Henry where i learned a lot about JavaScript, eager to acquire a lot of new experience and knowledge with and from my partners. I want to keep studying while working. I'm expecting new challenges and searching for a place to grow.
